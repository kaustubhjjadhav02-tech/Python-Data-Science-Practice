    "- **Background:**\n",
    "Bombay hospitality Ltd. operates a franchise model for producing exotic Norwegian dinners throughout New England. The operating cost for a franchise in a week (W) is given by the equation W = $1,000 + $5X, where X represents the number of units produced in a week. Recent feedback from restaurant owners suggests that this cost model may no longer be accurate, as their observed weekly operating costs are higher.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Objective:**\n",
    "To investigate the restaurant owners' claim about the increase in weekly operating costs using hypothesis testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Provided:**\n",
    "1. The theoretical weekly operating cost model: W = $1,000 + $5X\n",
    "2. Sample of 25 restaurants with a mean weekly cost of Rs. 3,050\n",
    "3. Number of units produced in a week (X) follows a normal distribution with a mean (μ) of 600 units and a standard deviation (σ) of 25 units.\n",
    "   \n",
    "- **Assignment Tasks:**\n",
    "1. State the Hypotheses statement:\n",
    "2. Calculate the Test Statistic:\n",
    "   Use the following formula to calculate the test statistic(z):\n",
    "   where:\n",
    "   -\tˉxˉ = sample mean weekly cost (Rs. 3,050)\n",
    "   -\tμ = theoretical mean weekly cost according to the cost model (W = $1,000 + $5X for X = 600 units)\n",
    "   -\tσ = 5*25 units\n",
    "   -\tn = sample size (25 restaurants)\n",
    "3. Determine the Probability and compare:\n",
    "   Using the alpha level of 5% (α = 0.05),\n",
    "4. Make a Decision:\n",
    "   Compare the test statistic with the critical value to decide whether to reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "5. Conclusion:\n",
    "   Based on the decision in step 4, conclude whether there is strong evidence to support the restaurant owners' claim that the weekly operating costs are higher than the model suggests."

    "**Note :** The null hypothesis (H₀) is the default assumption in statistical testing that there is no significant effect, no difference, or no relationship between variables in a population. It posits that any observed variation in sample data is due to random chance rather than a real phenomenon. Researchers aim to find enough statistical evidence to reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis (H₁ or Hₐ), which proposes a real effect or relationship exists. "
