# Python Assignment: Data Structures, Functions, NumPy & Pandas

This repository contains a Python assignment designed to strengthen understanding of core programming concepts, including Python data structures, control flow, NumPy arrays, and Pandas DataFrames.

---

## 📘 Assignment Overview
The assignment is divided into three main sections:

### **Section A: Data Structures & Control Structures**
Tasks include:
- Creating and modifying lists using operations like `append`, `extend`, `insert`, `remove`, `pop`, `clear`, `count`, `sort`, and `reverse`.
- Working with tuples and understanding immutability.
- Creating and analyzing sets with duplicate values.
- Building and updating dictionaries.
- Writing decision-making scripts using conditional logic.
- Implementing grading logic using Python conditions.
- Checking whether a number is positive, negative, or zero.

---

### **Section B: NumPy**
Tasks include:
- Creating scalars, 1D arrays, and 2D arrays using `np.array`.
- Generating arrays using `np.random.randint`.
- Creating a 4×4 NumPy array with random values.
- Converting a 3×3 NumPy array into a Pandas DataFrame.

---

### **Section C: Exploring Pandas**
Tasks include:
- Creating a DataFrame manually with columns: **Name, Age, City, Salary**.
- Using `.info()` and `.describe()` for data overview.
- Selecting specific columns.
- Dropping unwanted columns.
- Filling missing salary values with the mean.
- Removing duplicate rows.
