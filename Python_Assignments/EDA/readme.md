# 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis on a Dataset

## **Objective**
The goal of this assignment is to conduct a thorough exploratory analysis of the **cardiographic.csv** dataset to uncover insights, detect patterns, and understand the underlying structure of the data.  
The analysis uses statistical summaries, visualizations, and data manipulation techniques to explore each variable comprehensively.

---

## **Dataset Description**
Below are the likely interpretations of the dataset variables:

1. **LB** – Baseline Fetal Heart Rate (FHR), representing the average fetal heart rate over a period.  
2. **AC** – Accelerations in the FHR; usually a sign of fetal well-being.  
3. **FM** – Fetal Movements detected by the monitor.  
4. **UC** – Uterine Contractions, which may impact the FHR pattern.  
5. **DL** – Decelerations Late with respect to uterine contractions; may indicate fetal distress.  
6. **DS** – Decelerations Short or short-duration decelerations.  
7. **DP** – Decelerations Prolonged or long-lasting decelerations.  
8. **ASTV** – Percentage of Time with Abnormal Short-Term Variability in the FHR.  
9. **MSTV** – Mean Value of Short-Term Variability in the FHR.  
10. **ALTV** – Percentage of Time with Abnormal Long-Term Variability in the FHR.  
11. **MLTV** – Mean Value of Long-Term Variability in the FHR.

## **Tasks**

### **1. Data Cleaning and Preparation**
- Load the dataset into a DataFrame.  
- Handle missing values through imputation or deletion.  
- Fix data type inconsistencies (e.g., numbers stored as strings).  
- Detect and treat outliers if necessary.

---

### **2. Statistical Summary**
- Provide summary statistics for every variable.  
- Include central tendency (mean, median) and dispersion (standard deviation, IQR).  
- Highlight interesting observations from the summary.

---

### **3. Data Visualization**
- Create histograms or boxplots for numerical variables.  
- Use bar or pie charts to visualize categorical variable frequencies.  
- Generate scatter plots or correlation heatmaps to examine relationships.  
- Use advanced visualizations like pair plots or violin plots for deeper insights.

---

### **4. Pattern Recognition and Insights**
- Identify correlations and discuss their implications.  
- Detect trends or temporal patterns if applicable.  
- Summarize meaningful relationships between variables.

---

### **5. Conclusion**
- Summarize insights discovered during the exploratory analysis.  
- Discuss how findings may support decision-making or further research.

---

## **Deliverables**
- A detailed **Jupyter Notebook** containing the code, visualizations, and explanations.  
- A summary of findings, insights, and recommendations for future analysis based on the dataset.
