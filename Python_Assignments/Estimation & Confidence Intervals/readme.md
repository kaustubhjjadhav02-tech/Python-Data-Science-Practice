# 📏 Estimation and Confidence Intervals

## **Background**
In quality control processes, especially for high-value items, destructive testing is often required to evaluate product durability. Since each test destroys the item being inspected, only small sample sizes can be used, making confidence interval estimation crucial for drawing conclusions about overall product quality.

---

## **Scenario**
A manufacturer of computer print-heads wants to estimate the **mean durability** of their product, measured in millions of characters printed before failure. Because the testing method is destructive, the study is conducted on a small sample of print-heads.

---

## **Data**
Durability (in millions of characters) for 15 randomly selected print-heads:

1.13, 1.55, 1.43, 0.92, 1.25, 1.36, 1.32, 0.85, 1.07, 1.48, 1.20, 1.33, 1.18, 1.22, 1.29

## **Assignment Tasks**

### **a. 99% Confidence Interval Using Sample Standard Deviation**
- Assume the population standard deviation is **unknown**.  
- Construct a **99% confidence interval** for the true mean durability of the print-heads.  
- Use the **t-distribution** and explain each calculation step.

### **b. 99% Confidence Interval Using Known Population Standard Deviation**
- Assume population standard deviation = **0.12 million characters**.  
- Construct a **99% confidence interval** using the **z-distribution**.  
- Compare how the results differ when using sample vs. population standard deviation.

## **Deliverables**
- A Jupyter/Python file showing all calculations and reasoning  
- Confidence interval computations using both methods  
- Clear interpretation of the results
